"it is my great pleasure to welcome you here today, though this pleasure is clearly tinged with such great shared sadness at the news of the death of President Boris Trajkovski.Mr President, you come to the European Parliament at a crucial and defining time in the life of our European Union. This will be a year of renewal for our Parliament, our Commission and our strategic planning for the next five years. It is also a moment of renewal in the definition of the relations between the European Union and Croatia.As you are aware, Mr President, this parliament was the first in the Union to give its support by majority to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, which was the early and indispensable first step on your journey – our common journey – towards fulfilling a Croatian European vision.Our relationship is now at a moment not just of definition, but also of transformation, moving from ambitious declarations to action plans and fulfilling criteria. Our common goal is to see Croatia eventually as a Member State of the European Union. We should not underestimate the magnitude of that challenge: the prospect of membership of the European Union represents a powerful incentive for those with a reformist instinct in your parliament and in your public life at home.The perspective of membership is related not only to concrete progress and delivering results in many different areas of policy; it is also about exercising responsible and reliable partnership and solidarity with your regional neighbours and between the region and a wider Europe. It will demand – and I know you have this, Mr President – a deep respect for the rule of law and full, unconditional cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. I know that you have shown your personal attachment to this rule of international law by bearing witness before that tribunal in The Hague and setting your example, as a national leader, of the necessity to engage. We in this House have on several occasions been encouraged by recent dialogue with Croatian leaders. I know that these responsibilities are well understood by those who are charged to lead.Mr President, echoing the private tribute I paid you on a visit to Croatia some months ago, I should like, on behalf of this House, to pay tribute once again to your courageous act of leadership and reconciliation, when, with President Marovic of Serbia and Montenegro some time ago, you respectively apologised for what had happened in the past decade. This was not immediately received by all the political forces and commentators in your homeland as an act designed to give you popularity, but it is a measure of the man you are in terms of the leadership you are willing to give, and yours is a region which badly needs the healing power of that kind of leadership.Mr President, it is my pleasure to invite you to address the European Parliament.(Applause)(Protests from Mr Borghezio.)President" (1 uses) - parliamentary_markers

"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think we are heading for some difficult debates given that Parliament is pretty much agreed – even my group – that we oppose the across-the-board 10% cuts in funding. We would like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his preliminary work, even though we certainly envisage the need to amend some points of the negotiations. It has already been mentioned by Mr Mulder that there must still be a critical review of expenditure on Kosovo, of the assessment of expenditure on Kosovo. As a group, we also consider that there must also be a critical review of the fisheries agreement. In these areas also we must ensure more efficiency, more ecological principles. There are some points where a critical review may be necessary, e.g. the export agreement with Japan. Nevertheless, we believe that additional tasks – and in this case many additional tasks would pass to the European budget – must also mean additional funds being allocated. We therefore need a critical review of the Financial Perspective. We would like to thank the Commissioner for intimating this. In any case, we are prepared to cooperate constructively in this matter. We think that Kosovo can certainly be financed with fresh funds, but we consider that the other points – Turkey, the fisheries agreement, etc" (1 uses) - institutional_markers
